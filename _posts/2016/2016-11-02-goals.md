For anyone keeping score, I haven't updated my blog for over a year.

>Insert excuses here

I know that I should do, [Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) and [Somnez](https://twitter.com/jsonmez) both recommend it.

Anyway, I've come up with some goals for myself for the next year:

* Get on [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/)
   - Failing that, any other developer focused podcast will do
* Blog more regularly
* Contribute more to open source
* Release an open source project of my own
* Become rich and famous

So we shall see what happens.
