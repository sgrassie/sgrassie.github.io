Something I discovered fairly quickly when coding (cake)PHP in eclipse, is that, like code completion in Models, unless you do a little extra configuration, code completion in Views won't work.

If however, you make a slight modification to the Views index.ctp, and create a HtmlHelper() yourself, then you get code completion on $html-&gt;, and access to all the methods, and the rendered view isn't affected at all.

For example:

{% highlight php %}
<pre lang="PHP">
<?php
if(false)

{

$html = new HtmlHelper();

}

?>
{% endhighlight %}

I found the answer to this after posting on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/04b94b593714b394/9c71e02157bcaacd#9c71e02157bcaacd" target="_blank">CakePHP google group</a>, and getting a good answer from a user. Top Stuff
