Welcome to my new website, and my new blog. I'd kind of outgrown the old site, which I've now turned into a kind of "here's my CV" sort of site. Although I am happy in my job.

I'm going to attempt to write more often on here, about a lot of things. I'm still getting things just the way I like them - I've still got a few plugins for wordpress to download and install yet. If I get time I might even write my own theme, but considering there are so many already brilliant themes available I might just save myself the time and effort.

Hell, that's why I'm using Wordpress and not writing my own blogging system.

As an old friend of mine used to say: Onwards and Upwards!
