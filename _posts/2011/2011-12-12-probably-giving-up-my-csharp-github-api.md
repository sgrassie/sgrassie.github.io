<p>Ive been thinking that Im going to retire my <a href="https://github.com/sgrassie/csharp-github-api" target="_blank">CSharp Github API</a>. The ugly truth is that Ive barely worked on it, literally in months. I did a little bit recently, and I had one or two good ideas about certain things, but, I do have to be honest with myself. I am not not admitting defeat, I know that I am capable enough to finish it. </p>  <p>Im simply bored with it.</p>  <p>Also, someone has <a href="https://github.com/erikzaadi/GithubSharp" target="_blank">already beaten me to it</a>, and is writing something that is actually far superior to what Id managed to push out. In my defence, I havent done very much anyway, so anything that is fairly substantial is going to look better by default.</p>  <p>So, Im going to knock it on the head. Ill leave the code, such as it is, up on Github.</p>
