<blockquote><a title="C# WTF" href="http://neildanson.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/c-wtf/" target="_blank">So next time you find yourself in a C# ivory tower, looking down on other less fortunate languages, just remember that someone, somewhere is looking down on you and C#, laughing at the simple mistakes that could be easily avoided if only you’d used their language.</a></blockquote>
I don't think these words are just limited to just C#
